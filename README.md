# THIS PROJECT IS VAPORWARE

Gjallarbru is a tool for authoring web templates with quick feedback and
placeholders for external/backend data.

It may already be implemented! [charade](https://github.com/Soostone/charade)
has the same design goals, and may be the right path forward.

What design goals, you ask?

1. Get out of the way of HTML/CSS developers

    Let them use their own tools and languages to build HTML/CSS.
2. Integrate seamlessly into a Haskell web app

    The templates themselves must require no modification.
    Dropping the HTML/CSS into template dirs should require no more work than
    calling generated functions with the right parameters.
